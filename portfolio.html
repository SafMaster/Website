    <h1>These Are The Projects I Have Completed!</h1>
      <br>
    <h1>Snowman Scarf Thing</h1>
 <a href="https://trinket.io/python/20b18f13c4d9" target_blank><img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/snowguy.PNG?raw=true" class="aligncenter"></a>
      <br>
<a>This is my 1.1 snowman project. Luna and I made a turtle look like a snowman. We asked the players if they wanted a scarf. If they say no the <br>snowman gets sad and moves downward until it goes off screen, immitating the snowman melting. If you choose yes for wanting a scarf <br>the snowman asks you what color scarf you want and you can choose between four options. When the snowman gets it's scarf the snowman <br>gets really happy and bounces around. The hardest part of this project was turning the turtle into a snowman. That took multiple days <br>to figure out. The rest went by pretty quickly.</a>
    <h1>Cop Chase Game</h1>

	    <br>
     <a>This is my 1.2 project, where I made a two player game where a robber (Gru) runs from a cop (Officer Earl) on a star shape. They use the keys 1-5 to <br>move the players in turn. The hardest part was cloning the turtles (circles that the characters travel to and from), so that I could more easily code movement.</a>

    <h1>   Interactive Spongebob Card</h1>

      <br>
      <a>This project is for a Childrens Hospital. The game starts as a card saying "hope you feel better." Then when you click the screen it closes and opens a game where Spongebob trys 
      <br>to collect all the Krabby Patties and avoid the jellyfish. The game is very random, different every time, and it keeps score of how many Krabby Patties you have gotten so far.</a>
      <br>
    <h1> Smart Fish Tank Fixing </h1>

      <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/Capture.PNG?raw=true" height="300">
     <br>  <a> In this project we didn't make a game! I know it's crazy. This time we fixed a fish tank for a company and found a potental security breach in their <br>system. This project was definitely different from my others. We didn't even use turtle methods and we found out how to create windows and buttons. </a>

    <h1>Just Shapes and Beats Scratch Project</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/shape.PNG?raw=true" height="300">
      <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/beats.PNG?raw=true" height="300">
    <br>
      <a>This is my Just shapes And Beats Scratch project where we made a game with an amimation where you have to try and avoid pink as a square.</a>
    <h1>GUI Tkinter Project</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/project%20dumb.PNG?raw=true" height="300"> <br>
       <a>In this project we created a GUI for people to use that checks if a website is active, then collects the data, and records how long it took and how much of the data was lost.</a>
       <br>
    <h1>Rover landing Project</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/Capture21.PNG?raw=true" height="300"> <br>
       <a>In this project we sorted data from a rover that landed on another planet to find out what biome it landed in. <br> We sorted through gyroscope, sound, temperature, and light. Our finial dicovery was that the rover landed in aa marsh land.</a>
    <h1>Honey Production Project</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/Capture2.PNG?raw=true" height="300"> <img src="https://github.com/SafMaster/Website/blob/main/Website/Capture39.PNG?raw=true" height="300"> <br>
       <a>In this project we sorted data from honey farms across the country. We sorted the data to show the state average <br> honey production, the honey production per year, the honey production per year for small, medium, and large honey producing states, and by year. Above is some of the data we graphed.</a>
