    <h1>These Are The Projects I Haven't Done Yet</h1>

    <h1>Snowman Scarf Thing</h1>

<a>This is my 1.1 snowman project. Luna and I made a turtle look like a snowman. We asked the players if they wanted a scarf. If they say no the snowman gets sad and moves downward until it goes off screen, immitating the snowman melting. If you choose yes for wanting a scarf the snowman asks you what color scarf you want and you can choose between four options. When the snowman gets it's scarf the snowman gets really happy and bounces around. The hardest part of this project was turning the turtle into a snowman. That took multiple days to figure out. The rest went by pretty quickly.</a>
    <h1>Cop Chase Game</h1>

     <a>This is my 1.2 project, where I made a two player game where a robber (Gru) runs from a cop (Officer Earl) on a star shape. They use the keys 1-5 to move the players in turn. The hardest part was cloning the turtles (circles that the characters travel to and from), so that I could more easily code movement.</a>

	    <a>This project is for a Childrens Hospital. The game starts as a card saying "hope you feel better." Then when you click the screen it closes and opens a game where Spongebob trys to collect all the Krabby Patties and avoid the jellyfish. The game is very random, different every time, and it keeps score of how many Krabby Patties you have gotten so far.</a>
